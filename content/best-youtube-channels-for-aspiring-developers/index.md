Programming is a highly-valuable skill as more and more software is deeply embedded into daily lives and how human societies function.

But programming is not easy: it can take a lot of practice and working on real-world projects to become good at it.

To begin with, you donâ€™t need to be good: all you need is a growth mindset with a clear willingness to put in the time and effort to master the art (and science) of programming.
