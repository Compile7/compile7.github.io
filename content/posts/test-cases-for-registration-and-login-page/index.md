Writing test cases is an essential task for a tester in application testing. It requires experience and a keen eye for detail to build scenarios, meaning that an application tester needs to focus on creating a set of variables or conditions that will help them determine whether the software meets requirements and functions flawlessly.

To reduce that hassle, we have compiled a list of use cases that you need to test a signup or login page. We hope these will help you to create error-free registration/login pages.

## Before We Start

You should gather all the customer requirements you can. A helpful list of requirements are:

1. FirstName
2. Confirm Password
3. LastName
4. Address
5. UserName
6. PhoneNumber
7. Email ID
8. Gender
9. Password

Required fields are:
1. Email ID 
2. UserName
3. Password
4. Confirm Password 


Validation for fields:
1. Email
2. Password: It should be alphanumeric, and the length should be 8 to 32 characters.
3. PhoneNumber: Phone Numbers should only have Numbers, and country codes are required.

After successful Verification, an email should be sent to the user.

On Required fields, display `*`.

Now, letâ€™s begin with our test cases. Although most testers use Bugzilla or other test management tools to maintain test cases, you can also use Excel or spreadsheets.

## Test Cases for Registration Page

Create signup and login pages by assuming some client requirements, such as:

- Username and password are mandatory fields
- There is a cancel and reset button at the bottom of the form
- Radio buttons and checkboxes are placed correctly
- The Password limit should be 8-32 characters (alphanumeric).

Be a perfectionist. Happy testing!
