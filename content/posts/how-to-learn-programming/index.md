I have graduated with computer science and systems engineering. Yet, I‘m not a full-time programmer — and I never shipped production-grade code apart from coding simple mathematical and sorting algorithms in C, Java, and JavaScript.

Firstly, I was overwhelmed with the different programming languages I needed to learn each semester during my graduation days, which started with C, C++, and Java to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. In retrospect, I was only overwhelmed as I didn’t put more time and effort into learning and focused more on leisurely activities.

Secondly, I overlooked the learning part and pondered which language is better, has better features, and is more popular. This led me only to learn the basics of many languages as I hopped from one language to another relentlessly. And this was a sure recipe for failure.

Lastly, as I look back on my academics, I was good at mathematics but was never a fan. I liked physics more, even though it felt hard to understand and learn. However, programming generally suits people who enjoy mathematics and linear logic.

These circumstances, my misguided approach and mindset, and a lack of proper guidance led me not to become a programmer.

So, why I’m even writing this blog post, right? Who am I to say anything about *how to learn programming* when I haven’t coded much?

The answer is that I learned Git, which I struggled even to understand. But when I started using it slowly in an actual project, I picked it up by using it one step at a time and reaching out to others at work if I didn’t understand, even after I extensively searched online.

## Lessons from Learning Git
Firstly, **perseverance** is the key to learning and becoming good at anything. You have to show up every day for weeks, months, and years; fail and fail; pick yourself up and dust off; and, try again.

You won’t observe meaningful progress within a few days. But as you keep working every day and look back after a few months, you’ll see real progress.

Secondly, you need to complement perseverance with **commitment**. The commitment to focus on a specific language, framework, library, or technology. This strictly applies to beginners; as you learn, you’ll get into a zone where you understand broader patterns of learning and understand different languages, frameworks, and technologies.

However, you must commit and settle to progress competitively with your learning — there are no magic bullets.

Thirdly, **it takes time** — an awful lot of time and focus. You can compare yourself to others, but don’t judge yourself negatively by how much better others are around you. Just know that it takes time and that this is not a race. You will do just fine in your life and career, even if you become an above-average programmer.

Next, **ask for help**: when you’re unable to solve a problem or understand something, go out and ask for help. You can post questions on Reddit or StackOverflow. Or, seek mentors at your workplace or college. Don’t be afraid of looking dumb. Everyone is dumb at some point in time. Be comfortable with that.

Join some community Slack groups and Discord servers, and follow people relevant to you on Social Media. You’ll be surprised how much you will learn by actively participating in these communities.

Finally, **work on real projects**: while working on some challenges is essential initially to learn properly, the real learning and developing real-world skills happens when you work on projects that deliver value to a set of end-users — that is, you can join a workplace and contribute to open source projects to become skillful at developing in a way that delivers value.

## Advice on Continuous Learning
Once you become used to comfortably delivering useful code regularly, you’ll realize that continuous learning is part of the process. Sometimes, new versions of a technology offer better features or change the old ways of doing things, or you might need to move to an entirely different programming language.

But know that whatever you have learned earlier will help you to transition. All you need to do is show up, be persistent, and ask for help when you need it.

## Conclusion
Now you understand my approach to learning programming; it’s time to pick and choose a technology or framework to learn.

If you’re learning on your own, pick something most popular so that you’ll get better access to tutorials, and people online would have already discussed solutions to the most common problems and errors.

If you’re learning in a team, choose something that’s most common among your peers — it helps you understand and discuss things with a sense of belonging.
