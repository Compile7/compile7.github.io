# Complete Guide to Strict and Optional Cookies with Cookie Consent Law

## What are Cookies?
Cookies are a data storage mechanism and small pieces of text that are stored on a user’s device by a website. They can be either strict(required) or optional.

## What is the Difference Between Strict and Optional Cookies?
Strict cookies are necessary for the website to function properly, and without them, users may not be able to complete the desired action like purchasing or accessing application resources. These types of cookies are usually used to identify a specific user or to maintain data about a user's session. They are usually set by the website that is being visited, and they are not sent back to the originating website.

It is important to note that strict cookies can't be set by third-party sites and do not require user consent. 

Examples of essential cookies:
* Session ID – To remember your session when you click on one particular link.
* Session ID Cookie – A cookie that assists in remembering your previous session when you visit another page on an online site.
* Tracking Cookie – Used by Google Analytics or other third-party service providers to collect information about how you interact with their sites as well as how visitors interact with your sites. This kind of cookie is often used by companies who want to provide targeted ads on their websites or social media accounts.

**Optional cookies** are used to provide additional features or functionality to the user's experience. For example, storing users’ preferences and other information about users that can enhance their experience on the website. For example, cookies target a particular user and only serve them with relevant advertisements based on their previous browsing behavior. As such, they do not contain any personal information about the user and can be deleted at any time.

## Are There Any Rules for Strict or Optional Cookies?

There is no universal law or regulation on cookies. Different jurisdictions have different laws and regulations on strict and optional cookies, which can vary from country to country and even state to state.

Some countries have laws that require websites to tell users about their use of cookies before storing any information in them at all, while others require websites only to ask for explicit consent before storing any information in them for the first time.

Cookies are not always required for websites and can be disabled by users through their web browser settings. The following is a list of GDPR guidelines for those who want to use cookies: 

* A website should inform users about cookies. The easiest way to inform users about the use of cookies and get consent is through the cookie banner.  

* Users should have the option to accept or reject the optional cookies. Thus, the cookie banner should display the options to accept or decline optional cookies with no option to decide on strict cookies. 

* Rejecting optional cookies should be as easy as accepting them. Thus, the cookie banner should always have a visible decline or reject option for optional cookies.
**Important:**  [In January 2022, Google and Facebook were fined  $170M and ~$60M,](https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/cnil-facebook-google-cookie-consent-eprivacy-breaches/)respectively, for breaching French law, following investigations of how they present tracking choices to users of google.fr, youtube.com, and facebook.com.

* The cookie policies link should be available in the cookie banner. 

* The option to view details on why the website is using cookies should be available in the cookie banner.

* Users should be individually able to select which options cookie they want to accept or reject.

## What are Common GDPR Cookie Banner Mistakes?

* A cookie banner that communicates - By visiting this website, you agree to the use of cookies. Since this is considered notice to the user rather than a choice.
Automatically considering acceptance of cookies after the user has spent some time on the website or has performed any actions.

* Using a pseudo cookie banner that forces users to accept all cookies to access the website.

* Not maintaining cookie consent logs of users - The website should maintain cookie consent logs of users of when and how they provided consent.

* Not having an up-to-date cookie banner. Whenever cookies on the website change, i.e. addition or removal of cookies should also reflect on the cookie banner.

* Classifying optional cookies as essential or strict.

## Conclusion 
There are no universal cookie laws yet, but it is better to comply with the most common cookie laws described above, as websites available worldwide can be accessed by users residing in cookie law-compliant regions. Also, users prefer to know what information is being captured via cookies and decide on whether to give access to optional cookies or not.
