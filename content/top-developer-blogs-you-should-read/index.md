As a developer, it can be tough to stay on top of the developments around frameworks, libraries, and languages — and the new approaches to developing applications and web services.

So, it’s essential to read some interesting blogs that help you keep updated. But again, there are too many blogs online, and it can be time-consuming to find the best blogs worthy of your time.

Fret not; we have thoroughly researched and handpicked a few developer-oriented publications with interesting blog posts.

Let’s go :) 
## GitHub.Blog
A developer’s journey is almost incomplete without having Git version control in their toolkit. And the best place to host and manage Git repositories is GitHub, either open- or closed-source projects.

Over the years, GitHub has evolved so much from just a Git repository hosting platform, from offering numerous collaborative features to dev, security, testing, and deployment features.

Even if you don’t rely on GitHub in your day-to-day work, keeping an eye on GitHub’s evolution will help you as a developer. And for that, GitHub Blog is the best place — in addition to offering detailed updates about GitHub and explaining how you can leverage its features, it shares numerous updates on Git and the open source universe.

For a glimpse, this article on [Git’s database internals I: packed object store](https://github.blog/2022-08-29-gits-database-internals-i-packed-object-store/) is a good example.

## StackOverflow.Blog
Since you've been learning to code, you have been asking questions about errors and how to get something specific done. And Google has been more so often shown the path to Stack Overflow. Since then, Stack Overflow has been a familiar ground to go to to get some things done and get clarified on serious coding problems.

So, why not follow StackOverflow.Blog? The blog is also called The Overflow and shares some of the most interesting and helpful essays, opinions, and advice on programming.

For a glimpse, [I spent two years trying to do what Backstage does for free](https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/12/21/i-spent-two-years-trying-to-do-what-backstage-does-for-free/) is a google example.

## Swiggy Bytes
Swiggy is an Indian on-demand food and grocery delivery platform serving millions of customers. If you’re building consumer-facing applications, Swiggy Bytes is a must-read blog.

It consists of blog posts explaining everything from fixing production-impacting bugs to optimizing their platform to deliver world-class consumer experiences.

For a glimpse, [BehindTheBug — Indexing Gone Wrong](https://bytes.swiggy.com/behindthebug-indexing-gone-wrong-6b4d682fd805) is a good example.

## A List Apart
This blog has been around since 1998, discussing everything about web design and development. While the blog is not updated as frequently as you may expect, it publishes valuable blog posts that help you rethink web development with a new thinking hat.

For example, [Breaking Out of the Box](https://alistapart.com/article/breaking-out-of-the-box/) discusses how web design has usually been about fitting content and user experiences into a box-based view and helps you rethink that approach.

## Smashing Magazine
It is an independent blog about web design and development, featuring fascinating, educational posts about various topics, including JavaScript, React, Vue, and CSS.

For example, [Code Documentation, Streamlined](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/01/swimm-code-documentation-streamlined/) explains the importance of documenting your code and how you can streamline documenting your code.

## Compile7 Blog
Yay! We’re talking about ourselves: [Compile7 Blog is an open source project](https://github.com/Compile7/compile7.github.io) for helping developers learn and share their learnings, opinions, and advice with the broader developer community.

Ultimately, we want to create and maintain the Compile7 Blog as an interesting and welcoming place for developers of any kind.

And we publish interesting posts like this: [How to Deploy a React App Using PM2 and Serve](https://compile7.org/decompile/react-app-deployment/)

## Changelog
It offers fascinating insights and stories to developers on various topics, ranging from automation, programming, and architecture to tech stacks and deadlines.

For example, [Arbitrary deadlines are actually awesome](https://changelog.com/posts/arbitrary-deadlines-are-actually-awesome) is a thoughtful post to read.

## Conclusion
While this is not an exhaustive list, these blogs offer good value for your time and can make you an enlightened developer (pun intended!).
