Managing user identity and access is fundamental in building modern applications. The phenomenon has become more important with the rise of cloud computing and mobile devices.

In general, Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) solutions provide businesses with the tools to securely and efficiently manage identity processes and workflows, such as user registration, login, password resets, forgotten passwords, and other key functions.

However, implementing a CIAM solution can be complex and time-consuming, especially for developers who need to build these features into their applications from scratch. That's where an AI-powered VS Code extension LRBuddy comes in; it helps streamline the process and makes implementation faster, easier, and more accurate.
