Despite JavaScript is a single-threaded language, Event Loop in Node.js gives a provision to handle non-blocking I/O operations by offloading asynchronous operations to the call stack whenever possible.

## Prerequisites

**Synchronous programming**

Synchronous programming refers to the execution of code in the stated order. In a synchronous program, the subsequent line of code won't be performed until after a function has been called and returned a value.


**Asynchronous programming**

Asynchronous programming refers to the code that doesn't execute in order. These functions are performed not according to the sequence they are defined inside a code but only when certain conditions are met.

## How to code run inside Node.js 

![node.js environment](node_environment.png)

Here in the code, the first and fifth statement is synchronous code while the file read operation is asynchronous code. In Node.js synchronous code runs first hence it will move to the Call Stack and give the output of console statements. But the async file read operation will move to libuv library which in turn moves it to the Event Loop, as the event loop handles all the asynchronous operations. After that whenever the call stack gets empty, the Event Loop passes the callback to the call stack for execution. 

How event loop handles asynchronous operations/code

![Event loop phases](event_loop_phases.png)

There are five different phases in an Event Loop and every phase has its own callback queue to handle asynchronous operations but before each phase, there are two more microtask callback queues that get executed. These are process.nextTick() and Promise microtask callback queue. Among these two queues process.nextTick is given priority. 

Execution Order of code in Event Loop

1. In the initial step process.nextTick() microtask callback queues and Promise microtask callback queues will be executed completely.

2. Timers phase - It will execute and handles setTimeout() and setInterval() callback inside an event loop.

3. process.nextTick() microtask callback queues and Promise microtask callback queue will be executed completely.

4. Input/Output Logic phase - It will execute all the input output-related calls, database calls  and third-party API's calls.

5. process.nextTick() microtask callback queues and Promise microtask callback queue will be executed completely.

6. Polling phase - In this phase, it handles all the incoming requests.

7. process.nextTick() microtask callback queues and Promise microtask callback queue will be executed completely.

8. Check phase - In the check phase it will execute and handles setImmediate() callback inside an event loop.

9. process.nextTick() microtask callback queues and Promise microtask callback queue will be executed completely.

10. close phase - It will execute all the closing operations like process.exit().

If there are more callbacks to be processed, the loop is kept alive for more runs and the same steps are repeated.

## How asynchronous functions are handled in an event loop 

**setTimeout()**

```js
console.log('first'); //sync code execute first

setTimeout(()=>{// async event loop phase 1 timers code
    console.log('second'); 
},0);

console.log("third"); //sync code execute first
```
**Output**

![setTimeout](setTimeout.png)


Firstly it will execute synchronous code inside the call stack and prints the synchronous console logs i.e. "first" and "third". After that, it will move the asynchronous function setTimeout() in the event loop and will be handled inside the timer phase. On the first iteration of the event loop, it will create a callback of setTimeout() function and on the second iteration, it will pass the callback inside the call stack for execution and print the console statement.

**setImmediate()**
```js
const ms = 10;// when set ms is zero the order for timeout1, timeout2, immediate 1 may be in some random order due to slow initialization in the event loop when it comes from the sync code part  
console.log('first'); //sync code execute first

setImmediate(()=>{console.log('immediate 1')}); //async event loop phase 4 check code
setTimeout(()=>{console.log('time-out 1')},ms); //async event loop phase 1 timers code

setTimeout(()=>{
    console.log('time-out 2')
    setTimeout(()=>{console.log('time-out 3')},ms);
    setImmediate(()=>{console.log('immediate 2')});
},ms);

console.log("second"); //sync code execute first
```
**Output**

![setImmediate](setImmediate.png)

Firstly it will execute synchronous code inside call stack and prints the synchronous console logs i.e. "first" and "second". After that it will move the asynchronous function setTimeout() and setImmediate() inside the event loop and will be handled in the timer phase and check phase respectively.  On the first iteration of the event loop it will create a callback of both setTimeout() functions in the timer phase and move to the check phase to create a callback of the setImmediate() function. On the second iteration, since the setTimeout() callback time is not yet completed it will move to the check phase and will pass the callback inside the call stack for execution and print the console statement "immediate 1" and after the setTimeout() time is completed it will execute their callback's and print out the statement "time-out 1"  "time-out 2" and the process will repeat for nested code.


**nextTick()**
```js
const ms = 10;
console.log('first'); //sync code execute first

setImmediate(()=>{console.log('immediate 1')}); //async event loop phase 4 check code
setTimeout(()=>{console.log('time-out 1')},ms); //async event loop phase 1 timers code

setTimeout(()=>{
    console.log('time-out 2')
    setTimeout(()=>{console.log('time-out 3')},ms);
    setImmediate(()=>{console.log('immediate 2')});
},ms);

process.nextTick(()=>{//async event loop microtask code runns in every phase
    process.nextTick(()=>{console.log('nexttick -2');});//async event loop microtask code runns in every phase
    console.log('nexttick -1');
});

console.log("second"); //sync code execute first
```
**Output**

![nextTick](nexttick.png)

Firstly it will execute synchronous code inside the call stack and prints the synchronous console logs i.e. "first" and "second". It will then execute the process.nextick() inside the microtask callback queue and pass the callback inside the call stack for execution and print the console statement. After that, it will execute the nested process.nextick() as it has a higher priority. Then it will proceed for setTimeout() and setImmediate() functions. The process for these continues as explained earlier.

**Promise()**
```js
const ms = 10;
console.log('naman'); //sync code execute first

setImmediate(()=>{
    console.log('immediate 1');
    process.nextTick(()=>{console.log('nexttick -2')});
}); //async event loop phase 4 check code

setTimeout(()=>{
    console.log('time-out 1')
    Promise.resolve().then(()=>{console.log("promise 2")});
    setTimeout(()=>{console.log('time-out 3')},ms);
    setImmediate(()=>{console.log('immediate 2')});
    process.nextTick(()=>{console.log('nexttick -3')});
},ms);

Promise.resolve().then(()=>{console.log("promise 1")});
process.nextTick(()=>{console.log('nexttick -1');});//async event loop microtask code runns in every phase

console.log("agarwal"); //sync code execute first
```
**Output**

![Promise](promise.png)

Firstly the synchronous code inside the call stack is executed and synchronous console logs i.e. "first" and "second" statements are printed. Since process.nextTick() is having a higher priority than Promise so it will pass its callback inside the call stack for execution and print the console statement "nexttick -1". Then the callback of Promise will execute and for setTimeout() and setImmediate() functions the process continues as explained earlier.
